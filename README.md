# toss-the-coin
Python simulates coin tosses easily using the `random` module.
This Python program simulates a coin toss where the user plays against the computer. Here's a breakdown of the code:

User Function:

Asks the user to choose either "head" or "tail".
If the input is invalid, it prompts the user again until a valid choice is entered.
Computer Function:

The computer randomly selects between "head" or "tail" using the random.choice() method.
Main Function:

It starts by announcing the toss with a message.
The user makes their choice, and the computer generates its random choice.
The result of the toss is displayed.
If the user's choice matches the computer's, the user wins and the game ends.
Otherwise, the user is asked if they want to toss again. If they choose not to, the program ends with "DONE!!".
This simple game allows for an interactive toss experience using Python.
